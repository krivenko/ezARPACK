ezARPACK
========

ezARPACK is a C++11 wrapper around the `ARPACK-NG
<https://github.com/opencollab/arpack-ng>`_ FORTRAN 77 library designed to
solve large scale eigenvalue/eigenvector problems. It allows for solving large
scale eigenproblems for symmetric, asymmetric and complex double precision
matrices with a minimal amount of boilerplate code.

Unlike some other C++ ARPACK

.. that can be used in conjunction with a number of C++ vector/matrix algebra
.. libraries. It allows for solving large scale eigenproblems for symmetric,
.. asymmetric and complex matrices with a minimal amount of #boilerplate code.
